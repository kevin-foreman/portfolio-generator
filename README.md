# Portfolio Generator

## This is node application which will build a professional portfolio for a user based on their inputs

* This project was built based on a need to represent work and projects in a clean web page format
* This application solves the problem of trying to create and style a webpage, instead this application store all the html formatting, and the CSS styling and only relies on user inputs to showcase their work
* During the production of this project I learned ES6 syntax and operators, as well as Node.js, Node Project Manager modules, and modules built into Node.js
